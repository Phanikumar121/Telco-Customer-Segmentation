I need to gain more practical expereince to analyse it in a much better way.
In case of minor mistakes please accept this submission.This is my best interpretation.

I have selected variable on the basis of higher loadings and variable that explains most of the variables.

  For this case study I would choose 4 cluster solution as it best describes my data
  
  1) Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 of the four cluster solution are considered as premium customers.
     The main reason is they seem to use all the services provided by the telecom company.
     Males contribute 51% from these two segments. This segment should be given ocassional offers 
     They seem to be very loyal with the brand.

  2) The 3rd segment cluster are not so avid users of the services.They used the Internet calls service
     Very rarely when compared to other services. This segment should be given promotional internet
     packs so that they will know how to use internet calls service and start using it.Apart from that 
     they are not so loyal to the brand maybe they are using services of other telecom company.It should
     be noted and promotional packs should be introduced by observing the competitors packs.
    
  3)The 4th segment cluster customers seems to use the various outgoing services like "out sms","out calling",
    "out roaming","out calls international" and few other outgoing services very rarely .They use only the
     Incomming services very extensively.They seem to be money savers.Recharge Packs should be developed
     to these customers by providing maximum value for money .Like providing them various services for low price.
